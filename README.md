# Introduction
This is my code for the second project from React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux). 
I tried to commit often in this course, commenting what I learned along the way.

# Project Details
In this project we created a course tracker that displayed current courses, allow the user to enter new course, and remove them from the list.
This course built on the skills of project 1 and dove deeper into what we learned.

# Skills Learned
- Dynamic CSS
- Styled Components
- CSS Modules
